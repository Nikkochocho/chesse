This is a TODO list with improvements and new features;

* Start Checkmate implementation V
* Revaluate code and optimize it 

* Checks the other players list of pieces, see if camp of vision can block the king attack
- create a getter and setter for m_attacker that put king on check
- get m_attacker pos and king on check pos... subtract one from the other (just like iFree() does for dist_col and dist_row)
- call CanCheck() on each iteration_col and iteration_row (just like TrespassCheck() does and see if player can hit one of those)

* Checks if piece can be captured
- piece that checks king also gets status CHECK, player's list of pieces see if it can hit the CHECK piece (isOpponentKing() look alike)

* Checks if king can move its way outta the check (double check) V
