## Dependecies :memo:

In order to use `chesse` and its features, you have to acquire the following prerequisites beforehand:

### CMake 3.24

You may install the package on its official [page](https://cmake.org/). Higher versions are also supported.

- For **Linux**

    Ubuntu/Debian users can install the package by using the command **apt-get** on their Linux shell.

    It is also recommended to install by using the standard package manager offered by your prefered distro.

- For **MacOS**

    Mac users may obtain the package through [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### LCOV

- For **Linux**

    Ubuntu/Debian users can install the package by using the command below on their Linux Shell:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install lcov
    ``` 

- For **MacOS (MacPorts)**

    Mac users may obtain the package by using the following:

    ```shell
    sudo port install lcov
    ```

### GCOV

If gcov is not already installed on your machine, you may use the commands below.

- For **Linux**

    Ubuntu/Debian users can install the package by using the command below on their Linux Shell:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install gcov
    ```

- For **MacOS**

    Mac users may obtain the package by using the following:

    ```shell
    sudo port install gcov
    ```

## HowTo :rocket:

### Configuring VSCode IDE

At first, create a folder named **.vscode** to `chesse` root path. 

```shell
cd chesse
md .vscode
```

Copy whole folder content **chesse/doc/vscode_sample** into the created **.vscode** folder.

```shell
cp doc/.vscode_sample/* ./vscode
```

The **launch.json** file already has configurations for all supported `chesse` operating systems (Mac, Windows and Linux).

### Enabling LCOV tests

**By default, `chesse` doesn't build its lcov tests**. 

If you would like to check the coverage tests report, it is necessary to change the **settings.json** file on your **.vscode** folder from **false** to **true**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For now, `chesse` does **NOT** have coverage tests support for Windows.

## Chessboard and Commands :space_invader:

`chesse` commands follow what you may find on a typical chess notation: the column and row value of your piece's current position, followed by the desired position, as shown bellow:

```
d2
d4
```
If it's still your turn and your piece's current position didnÂ´t change, you might have used an invalid move, thus making it necessary to enter your coordinates again.

As soon as one of the players get a checkmate or a stalemate, `chesse` ends the game.
